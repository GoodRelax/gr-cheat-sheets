## SW Principle

| Word           | Full form                             | Meaning                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| KISS           | Keep It Simple, Stupid                | Prefer the simplest solution that works.                     |
| YAGNI          | You Aren’t Gonna Need It              | Don’t implement features until they are necessary.           |
| DRY            | Don’t Repeat Yourself                 | Avoid duplication of knowledge or logic.                     |
| SoC            | Separation of Concerns                | Separate different responsibilities into distinct parts.     |
| SRP            | Single Responsibility Principle       | A module should have one reason to change.                   |
| OCP            | Open/Closed Principle                 | Open for extension, closed for modification.                 |
| LSP            | Liskov Substitution Principle         | Subtypes must be substitutable for base types.               |
| ISP            | Interface Segregation Principle       | Prefer many small interfaces over one large one.             |
| DIP            | Dependency Inversion Principle        | Depend on abstractions, not concretions.                     |
| SOLID          | SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP               | Five core object-oriented design principles.                 |
| SLAP           | Single Level of Abstraction Principle | Keep each function at one level of abstraction.              |
| LOD            | Law of Demeter                        | Only talk to immediate collaborators.                        |
| CQS            | Command Query Separation              | Methods should either change state or return data, not both. |
| POLA           | Principle of Least Astonishment       | Behavior should match user expectations.                     |
| PIE            | Program Intently and Expressively     | Write code that clearly expresses intent and purpose.        |
| CA             | Clean Architecture                    | Organize systems around use cases and boundaries.            |
| Naming matters | Naming matters                        | Good names improve readability and understanding.            |
