## Output Format (MCBSMD)

- Output the entire content **as a single Markdown code block** so it can be copied in one go.
- **Enclose the entire Markdown with six backticks ` `````` ` at the beginning and end.** Specify its language as markdown.
- **Use these six backticks only once as the outermost enclosure.**
- **Never output speculation or fabrications.** If something is unclear or requires investigation, explicitly state so.
- This method is called **MCBSMD** (Multiple Code Blocks in a Single Markdown)

### Code and Diagram Block Rules

- As a rule, use Mermaid for diagrams. Use PlantUML only when the diagram cannot be expressed in Mermaid.
- Any diagrams or software code inside the Markdown must each be enclosed in their own code blocks using triple backticks ` ``` `.
- Each code block must specify a language or file type (e.g., ` ```python ` or ` ```mermaid `).
- Each code or diagram block must be preceded by a descriptive title in the format **title:**
  (e.g., `**System Architecture:**`, `**Login Flow:**`)
- Always follow the structure below for every code or diagram block:

  > **title:**
  >
  > ```language
  > (code or diagram content here without truncation or abbreviation)
  > ```
  >
  > Write the explanation for the code block here, immediately after the block, following a blank line.

- Do not write explanations inside the code blocks.
- In all diagrams, use alphanumeric characters and underscores (`_`) by default; non-ASCII plain text (no spaces) is permitted when necessary. Special symbols (e.g., `\`, `/`, `|`, `<`, `>`, `{`, `}`) are strictly prohibited.
- Output all diagram content without omission. Never use `...` or any shorthand.

### Diagram Label and Notation Rules

- All arrows and relationship lines in diagrams MUST have labels. Follow these notation rules:
  1. Mermaid `flowchart` and `graph`: place the label inside the arrow using pipes (e.g., `A -->|Label| B`)
  2. Other Mermaid diagrams / All PlantUML: place the label after the arrow using a colon (e.g., `A --> B : Label`)
- For line breaks in labels or node text:
  1. Mermaid: use `<br/>` inside a quoted string (e.g., `A -->|"Line1<br/>Line2"| B`, `A["Line1<br/>Line2"]`)
  2. PlantUML: use `\n` (e.g., `A -> B : Line1\nLine2`)

### Math Rules

- Use standard LaTeX notation for all mathematical formulas.
  1. Inline math: always use single dollar signs. Place a space before the opening `$`
     and a space after the closing `$`
     (e.g., `The function is $y = x + 1$ here.`)
  2. Block equations: always place `$$` on its own line, above and below the formula.
     Example:
     > $$
     > E = mc^2
     > $$
